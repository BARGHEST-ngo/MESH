        **MESH** is a custom fork of Tailscale with DPI protection and additional forensics and security features.

        Please check if your bug is [already filed](https://github.com/BARGHEST-ngo/MESH/issues) before filing a new one.

        **Note:** For issues with core Tailscale functionality (not MESH-specific features), please report to the [upstream Tailscale repository](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues).
